### Internship

* * *

Right before today's blog, I'd like to say something about what I do during my internship

It is pretty cool, all the technos are the newest.

### Personal thinkings

- Kind of tired of android development, nothing new to me, a lot of problem also, sqlite, root, object, multi-threads, cache, etc. Kill me...

- Recently I often got my eyes full of tears, maybe, I have used computer toooooo much.

- I'm wanna learn Perl, vim...

**Nothing special.**
