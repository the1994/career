If you want to take a look at the nature of South Africa, this could be the best blog that I have ever seen.

[Sons of Ader](http://sonsofader.tumblr.com/)

This blog is authored by [Ismael Ghalimi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghalimi), an entrepreneur living in Singapore and Palo Alto, CA. He is a passionate private pilot, professional SCUBA diver, and father of three. If you wonder why the blog is called the way it is, check his [first post](http://sonsofader.tumblr.com/post/84576362976/here-come-the-sons-of-ader) out.

Well, he is my boss too. Have fun!
