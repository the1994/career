Blogger Alex Popescu summarizes a presentation by Ben Scofield who gave a generic introduction to NoSQL databases along with a categorization and some ruby examples of different NoSQL databases. The categorization is in fact a short comparison of classes of NoSQL databases by some nonfunctional categories (“(il)ities“) plus a rating of their feature coverage. Popescu summarizes Scofield’s ideas as presented in table 2.4.
