# Preface

It has been really really long time since I used Python last time. Er, three years? Recently, I got to know a girl in Zhihu, surprisingly she is the gf of MY. What a pity, how I wish I could have a gf who likes programming... Joke time is over, let's begin the tuto.

# Installation

Well, everything begins with an installation. Lucky enough, down Fedora, it has been installed and configurated, good to go!

# Hello world

Firstly, type 

    python

After `>>>`, this is where your code starts. Let's try a hello world.

    print 'hello world'

Kid's staff...

# Quit

How to quit python command line? Fow now I know two ways,

    quit() # by calling python function

or

    Ctrl+D

# Editor

Er... Vim or Emacs, that's enough...

Here's the list of python editor, [http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors), anyway, you can always find one that you like.

Ah, right, you can also use some IDEs to make your build or test more efficiently, here is the list of IDE, [http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments).

# Run program

How to run program?

You can type `python [filename]`, or do it like this,

    chmod a+x [filename]
    ./[filename]

**PS**, if your hello world file is like this:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    # Filename : helloworld.py
    print 'Hello World'

The first line indicates that this file should be compiled by `/usr/bin/python`, so you can save your file with whatever suffix, even without suffix.
