## If

Example:

    \#!/usr/bin/python
    \# Filename: if.py 

	number = 23
	guess = int(raw_input('Enter an integer : '))

	if guess == number:
		print 'Congratulations, you guessed it.' \# New block starts here
		print "(but you do not win any prizes!)" \# New block ends here
	elif guess < number:
		print 'No, it is a little higher than that' \# Another block
		\# You can do whatever you want in a block ...
	else:
		print 'No, it is a little lower than that' 
		\# you must have guess > number to reach here

	print 'Done'
    \# This last statement is always executed, after the if statement is executed

**PS**, There is no `switch` !!!

## While

Example

    \#!/usr/bin/python
    \# Filename: while.py

	number = 23
	running = True

	while running:
		guess = int(raw_input('Enter an integer : '))

		if guess == number:
			print 'Congratulations, you guessed it.' 
			running = False # this causes the while loop to stop
		elif guess < number:
			print 'No, it is a little higher than that' 
		else:
			print 'No, it is a little lower than that' 
	else:
		print 'The while loop is over.' 
		\# Do anything else you want to do here

	print 'Done'
