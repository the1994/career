# Preface

To be frankly, I like the Metro theme, it is simple, easy, fast and elegant. And more importantly, I have never tries it before.

Main resource configuration:

> CPU: 1 core, 2.1GHz
>
> Mem: 512MB
>
> Disk: 40G
>
> Other: defaut

The whole installation lasts about twenty minutes, if you need the product key, you can find it from microsoft official page, as it is a preview version, everythin is for free.

**PS**, personally, I use [Virtual Machine Manager](http://virt-manager.org/) instead of VirtualBox, because I really tired of those configuration of VirtualBox, usergroups, screen color, etc...

Have a good luck!
