After reading Ismeal's blog, [Performance Data for FormulaC++](http://sutoiku.com/post/102349188023/performance-data-for-formulac), I'm really excited about their work! Awesome job man! The desire of becoming a real [stoic](http://stoic.com/) is far stronger than ever.

Since October 1th, when I came back to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I found that Big Data is much more complex than what I know about it. I think it worthes the return.

Besides the daily work assigned by my prof, which requires me to work as a full stack developer (Avalon + Spring + Struts + Hibernate), I'm also working as a part-time front-end developer in the team [Fenyin (纷印)](https://fenyin.me). To tell the truth, it's a promising start-up, providing C2B online printing service, which greatly solves the problem of the long-waiting in front of the print shop. What I'm working is developing the website and co-operate with the backend team to interact.

Next week as expected, I would join the Data Center Group of Intel Aisa-Pasific Research Company, which is located besides the University, I wish I could finish my research project in this team and learn more about the power of Storm and Spark.

Well, that's pretty much what I'm doing right now. I know I also need to polished my English and French too. Long way to go!

Last but not least, the coming winter holiday, I'm going to take a look at the center and weat of China. Sounds exciting?
