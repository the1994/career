Concerning the classification of NoSQL stores Highscalability author Todd Hoff cites a presentation by Stephen Yen in his blog post “A yes for a NoSQL taxonomy”. In the presentation “NoSQL is a Horseless Carriage” Yen suggests a taxononmy that can be found in table 2.1.

A similar taxonomy which is less fine-grained and comprehensive than the classification above can be found in the article “Databases in the cloud” by Ken North. Table 2.2 summarizes his classification of datastores that additionally include some datastores available in cloud-computing environments only.

Similarly to the classifications mentioned above Rick Cattel subsumes different NoSQL databases primarily by their data model as shown in table 2.3.
