Hi my friends,

It is time that I had to say goodbye  T_T

There is an old saying which I could not agree more, how time flies! I still remember the frist day when I arrived at Lyon Perrache, rushed to confluence and called Lionel, and with my two big heavy packages before the office. It seems to be just yesterday.

I’m lucky enough to have the chance to take my internship here. I prefer Lyon much more than Paris. It is a fantastic city and makes me feel relax and comfortable. All the Wednesday midi, we play badminton, beach volleyball, and sure petanque this midi, my team wins! In July we had the picnic together and I tried at least five kinds of fromages! Sometimes in the morning during the cafe time, there would be some surprises, birthday, new baby to join or anniversary in Reportlinker, and sure cookies, juice, croissant, etc.

Reportlinker is such a competitive company with brilliant leaders, IT geniuses and a lot of marketing/financial experts! ^_^ In the front team, I learned plenty of new technos and my coding ability improved greatly. To tell the truth, my teammates are really really kind and enthusiastic, I can always find the solution with the help from my powerful teammates no matter what the problem is. 

By comparing with my former internships in China, I experienced the giant culture differences, both from the company and from the country. My teacher in Nancy had told me, this experience is a key point of my internship. I agree, it is also a key point in my life. I could not tell which one is better, but I do like the company’s culture in Reportlinker and I do respect you, my friends! This is exact the place where I dreamed of working for.

Well, it is really difficult to say goodbye, I shall keep all these happy memories in mind and I shall never forget you. Have a nice week-end and I wish you all a splendid future!

Bon courage!
